# Horoscope App!
https://horoscope-app-fjh.netlify.app/

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code this project.

For this project, my main focus was allowing my JS code to be organized but also efficient. I set up one basic function to take care of all the functionality of the app; I did this to keep my code organized and as short as possible.

### Lessons Learned :

- I learned to not write statements in conditionals as separate conditionals when they could be combined into one. Using logical operators made my code cleaner and actually a bit easier to read.
